To add a new version of OpenLayers:

- Download a "dist" release from GitHub into this directory:

  $ wget https://github.com/openlayers/ol3/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/vX.Y.Z-dist.zip

- Unzip that file:

  $ unzip vX.Y.Z-dist.zip

  You'll end with a directory structure like this:

    - vX.Y.Z-dist/
                  ol-debug.js
                  ol.css
                  ol.js

- Move the zip file somewhere outside the repo (or delete it).

- Rename vX.Y.Z-dist to just X.Y.Z.

- Open X.Y.Z/ol.js and change `define([], factory);` to
  `define('ol', [], factory);`. This is to make AMD loading work in
  production.
