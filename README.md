This repo contains the libraries we commonly use on web projects.

## To add/update a library

1. Create a directory named after the library (all lowercase characters please)
1. Create a subdirectory named after the library's version number (1.0.1 for
   example)
1. Drop all the library files in that subdirectory
1. Add/update the entry in libs.yaml making sure versions are sorted (the most
   recent version should be first)
